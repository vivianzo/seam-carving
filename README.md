# Seam Carving
This project was developed as part of Northeastern's Fundamentals of Computer Science II class during the Spring of 2024

# Logistics
The goal of this project was to make a photo editor that can shrink an image while keeping the most important parts. By calculating the brightness and weight of each pixel, we were able to remove a seam (which is either a string of pixels from each row of the image or each column of the image)

In addition to the main functionality of the seam carver, we also added some additional functionalities: 
* Added a red line to show the seam each tick before removing it 
* Pausing the seam carver
* Toggling between vertical seams, horizontal seams or randomly choosing horizontal or vertical seams
* Showing a grayscale of the brightness of each pixel
* Toggle the re-insertion of removed seams
